Description: 
    PaleoClim <http://paleoclim.org> is a database of free, high resolution 
  paleoclimate surfaces covering the whole globe. It includes the standard
  bioclimatic variables commonly used in ecological modelling, downscaled from
  the HadCM3 general circulation model for key time periods, at up to 2.5 minute
  spatial resolution.
    This package provides a simple interface for downloading PaleoClim data in R,
  with support for caching.
